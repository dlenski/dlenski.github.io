  <h1>Dan on Github: standard disclaimer about macOS in my projects</h1>

  <p>
  I've written and contributed to lots of open-source software tools, <a href="index.html">as you've probably already seen</a>. Almost
  all of the software I write specifically targets GNU/Linux in the desktop or server environment.
  </p>

  <p>
  Users of software I contribute to are very frequently asking for help with macOS (and occasionally other POSIX OSes, like
  FreeBSD or Solaris). But most frequentlyâ€¦ macOS. Some things to keep in mind about <b>me</b>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I <b>do not use macOS</b>. I do not <b>want</b> to use macOS</b>. Same for iOS. Same for iPadOS.</li>
    <li>You would have to pay me to go to the trouble of even trying macOS or iOS. Even if you <i>are</i> paying me, and even if
      All The Cool Kids at the company are using macOS and iOS, <b>I</b> will probably request to use GNU/Linux desktop environment and
      an Android phone if at all possible.</li>
    <li>macOS is <b>not</b> "just like Linux", especially not in terms of its kernel or its networking functionality.</li>
    <li>I have <i>lots</i> of interest and personal motivation to make GNU/Linux better, and to make software that I write work better on it.</i>
    <li>I have <i>some</i> personal motivation to make other free/open-source operating systems better (say, the open-source core
      of Android, or FreeBSD).</li>
    <li>I have <i>just about zeeeeeeero</i> internal motivation to improve macOS, or to make any particular software work better on
      macOS.</li>
    <li>It's an enormous pain in the ass to test anything on macOS. There are plenty of high-quality free-as-in-beer CI/CD services
      that will let me spin up an automated testing environment for GNU/Linux distros, like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI. There
      are <b>none</b> for macOS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If you want to improve support for macOS in a project of mine, I'm very happy to accept contributions for this, but most of the burden
    is going to be on <i>you</i> (and other macOS users) who care to contribute:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You're going to have to diagnose, describe, and document the issues yourself.</li>
    <li>You're going to have to design and test the solutions yourself. "Pull requests welcome"</li>
    <li>You're going to have to make sure that your contributions don't introduce regressions or make the code difficult to
      maintain for platforms that I personally care about. (Hey, have I mentioned Linux?)</li>
    <li><b>See <a href="https://github.com/dlenski/vpn-slice/pull/11">dlenski/vpn-slice#11</a> for an example of a PR to improve
      macOS support that cleared this bar.</b></li>
  </ul>
